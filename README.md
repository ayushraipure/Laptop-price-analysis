# Laptop Price Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes various laptop models and their prices using **Python, Machine Learning, SQL, and Excel**. The goal is to identify key factors affecting laptop prices and build predictive models to estimate pricing based on specifications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **SQL** (Data extraction and transformation)
- **Excel** (Data cleaning and visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook & VS Code** (Development environments)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes various laptop attributes such as:
- Brand
- Processor type
- RAM & Storage capacity
- GPU details
- Screen size & resolution
- Price

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Findings
- **Price Trends:** Identified the impact of brands, specifications, and features on pricing.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Found significant relationships between price and hardware specifications.
- **Predictive Model:** Built an ML model to predict laptop prices with high accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Used bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps for insights.

## 🚀 Machine Learning Model
- **Regression Model:** Trained a multiple linear regression model to predict laptop prices.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated model accuracy using RMSE and R-squared values.

## 📊 Insights & Business Impact
- Consumers can make better purchasing decisions.
- Retailers can optimize pricing strategies based on market trends.
- Helps manufacturers understand customer preferences.
